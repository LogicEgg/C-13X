## Features
- QAZ-ish alice layout
- Gasket mount
- 5mm thick plate
- Clear window on the back to display wiring
- VIA support (if you choose to wire the matrix the same as I did)

## You will need:
- 35x MX style switches
- 35x Diodes
- Elite-C controller (the cutout on the bottom is specifically designed for an Elite-C; so a promicro will not work)
- Wires of your choice
- Gaskets (This is designed to work with KBDFans's D65 gaskets, but any gaskets should work as long as they are not over 4mm wide)
- 8x m2x6 screws
- (Optional) 2x 2u plate mount stabiliers
- (Optional) Feet (I used 3M SJ1502s, but any feet 8mm in diameter should work)
- (Optional) Clear plastic/acryllic sheet for the window on the back

### Note for via users
To get the board properly showing up in VIA, you will need to go into VIA > File > Import Keymap and then select the "C-13X.json" file
